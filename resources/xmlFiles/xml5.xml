Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox attacked Konohagakuredestroying much of the village and taking many lives. The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children taking their cues from their parents inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged,Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.
